- I like the idea of a top down simulation 
- player acts like a mayor
	- maybe stages like besiege 
- goal is to make relationships with the place around you
	- maybe a pool of traits things can have gets pulled from at random? 
	- player can create living things?
	- player can draw the play area?


- features 
	- automated creep behavior
